#
# Create a Docker container from an existing image of the built software
# environment, but with the source, data and build (analysis) directories
# directly within the host file system. This script is assumed to be run in
# the top project source directory (that has 'README.md' and
# 'paper.tex'). If not, use the '--source-dir' option to specify where the
# Maneage'd project source is located.
#
# Usage:
#
#   - When you are at the top Maneage'd project directory, run this script
#     like the example below. Just set the build directory location on your
#     system. See the items below for optional values to optimize the
#     process (avoid downloading for exmaple).
#
#        ./reproduce/software/shell/docker.sh --shm-size=20gb \
#                    --build-dir=/PATH/TO/BUILD/DIRECTORY
#
#   - Non-mandatory options:
#
#       - If you already have the input data that is necessary for your
#         project, use the '--input-dir' option to specify its location
#         on your host file system. Otherwise the necessary analysis
#         files will be downloaded directly into the build
#         directory. Note that this is only necessary when '--build-only'
#         is not given.
#
#       - If you already have the necessary software tarballs that are
#         necessary for your project, use the '--software-dir' option to
#         specify its location on your host file system only when
#         building the container. No problem if you don't have them, they
#         will be downloaded during the configuration phase.
#
#   - To avoid having to set them every time you want to start the
#     apptainer environment, you can put this command (with the proper
#     directories) into a 'run.sh' script in the top Maneage'd project
#     source directory and simply execute that. The special name 'run.sh'
#     is in Maneage's '.gitignore', so it will not be included in your
#     git history by mistake.
#
# Known problems:
#
#   - As of 2025-04-06 the log file containing the output of the 'docker
#     build' command that configures the Maneage'd project does not keep
#     all the output (which gets clipped by Docker). with a "[output
#     clipped, log limit 2MiB reached]" message. We need to find a way to
#     fix this (so nothing gets clipped: useful for debugging).

Usage: $scriptname [OPTIONS]

Top-level script to build and run a Maneage'd project within Docker.

 Host OS directories (to be mounted in the container):
  -b, --build-dir=STR      Dir. to build in (only analysis in host).
  -i, --input-dir=STR      Dir. of input datasets (optional).
  -s, --software-dir=STR   Directory of necessary software tarballs.
      --source-dir=STR     Directory of source code (default: 'pwd -P').

 Docker images
      --base-os=STR        Base OS name (default: '$base_os').
      --base-name=STR      Base OS docker image (default: $base_name).
      --project-name=STR   Project's docker image (default: $project_name).
      --image-file=STR     [Docker only] Load (if given file exists), or
                           save (if given file does not exist), the image.
                           For saving, the given name has to have an
                           '.tar.gz' suffix.

 Interactive shell
      --project-shell      Open the project's shell within the container.
      --container-shell    Open the container shell.

 Operating mode:
  -q, --quiet              Do not print informative statements.
  -?, --help               Give this help list.
      --shm-size=STR       Passed to 'docker build' (default: $shm_size).
  -j, --jobs=INT           Number of threads to use in each phase.
      --build-only         Just build the container, don't run it.

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or
optional for any corresponding short options.
